A potent virus can steal sensitive information like your credentials or passwords, encrypt and lock you out of your data, make individual transactions within apps, monitor your computer, and even attack other devices on connected networks. A virus has the potential to access nearly everything that is locked away on your hardware.

Once a virus has propagated onto your laptop or desktop, it can infect all your programs and applications without prejudice. Its destructive code can and likely will spread everywhere. That is why it is crucial to utilize a virus scanner.
